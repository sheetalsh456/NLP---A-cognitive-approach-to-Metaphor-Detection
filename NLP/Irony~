Irony is a common tool used in literature to help tell a story. If you need a research paper that examines irony in a specific piece of literature, the writers at Paper Masters can explicate the tool of irony that many authors use.

Irony is a literary and rhetorical device in which a what appears on the surface is radically different from reality. Irony can be verbal, dramatic, or situational, often employing simile or sarcasm in order to emphasize disconnect. The term has roots in Greek theater, but came into English usage in the 16th century. In speech, “irony” is commonly confused and misused for the term “ironic.”
Types of Irony in Literature

Verbal irony is when a speaker makes a statement but employs language that is sharply different than the intended meaning, and is produced intentionally by the speaker. Below are some examples of irony in works of literature:

    IronyA classic example of verbal irony occurs during Mark Antony’s speech (“Friends, Romans, countrymen…”) in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.
    Dramatic irony involves a situation where the audience is aware of information that the characters are not. For example, in Oedipus the King, the audience is aware that Oedipus is the murderer of his father, but he is not.
    Situational irony, a modern interpretation, is a sharp discrepancy between expected results and actual results. O. Henry’s short story “The Gift of the Magi” is an example of situational irony.
    One other form of irony involves the discrepancy between historical perspective and how people viewed the events first hand. The most telling example of historical irony was how World War I became known as “the war to end all wars,” but the very seeds of World War II were planted in that conflict.
